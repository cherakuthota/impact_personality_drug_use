# Personality vs. Risk of Drug Use (Easy-Medium)  

The abuse of tobacco, alcohol and illicit drugs is costly to our society. According to 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, more than 740 billion is lost annually due to lost work productivity, 
crime and healthcare.  
People with certain personality traits may be at increased risk for drug use problems, 
and studying personality may help researchers better under stand and treat these problems.
Attempting to link genetic disposition to substance use disorders has proven unsuccessful.
There are however many studies that have shown positive correlations between risky personalities 
and drug use. Understanding this relation could lead to better treatment.
The dataset used for this project is referenced. There are limitations to the study since the collected 
sample is biased with respect to the general world population but it remains useful for 
risk evaluation. Each column of attributes has been normalized using T-score sand is described below.
